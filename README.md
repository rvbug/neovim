Before you go down this path, there are few things to keep in mind :

1. This is going to be challenging .. but what's the fun if it's easy.
2. You need to have lot of patience so take small steps.
3. Give yourself enough time to learn as Vi/Vim has a steep learning curve.

  - `brew install neovim` - This will install NeoVim

  - `brew install ripgrep` - Real time grep
  - `brew upgrade nvim` - If you want to upgrade to the latest stable version of neovim  


# Packages 
  - Lazy - We will be using Lazy as our package manager. This is much more efficient 
  - Color Scheme - This is personal preference, you can install the package you like
